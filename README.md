# Private Events

> Built with Ruby on Rails with more emphasis on Active Record associations


Additional description about the project and its features.

In this project, we used ActiveRecord’s associations to model the workings of a private event website.
We created associations between our models so as to enable a user to create events and attend many events. Also, an event can be attended by many users.
